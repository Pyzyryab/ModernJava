## Core types
### Result
The result implementation aims to mimic the behaviour of the powerful
`Result<T, E>` enumerated type found on the `std` library
of the Rust language.

Result allows to implement a functional kind of code approach to
tasks or operations that, due its inherent implementation, may be
fallible or that they may throw some exception

>For see the implementation, go take a look at the `result` folder on the *src/main/java/eu/zerodaycode/core/result* package

>For a usage example, go take a look at the `test` folder on the *src/test/java/result* package
